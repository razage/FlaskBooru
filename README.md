# Notice
I've put this project on indefinite haitus. I don't know if I'll ever work on it again, so it's provided as-is.

## Flaskbooru
A Flask implementation of a [*booru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard#Danbooru-style_boards) application.

The goal of this (or really, any *booru application) is to store images and organize them by tags. These tags allow you to get ultra-specific and make finding exactly what you want easy. For example, you could find pictures from your 2012 Family reunion, with a certain family member in them, while they're standing in your driveway. Or a girl with black hair and green eyes, and she's eating an apple. 

This level of data probably isn't necessary for every collection of images, but you probably know if something like this is useful to you already.
